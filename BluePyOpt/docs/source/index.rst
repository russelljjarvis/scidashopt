BluePyOpt
=========

The Blue Brain Python Optimisation Library (BluePyOpt) is an extensible 
framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and 
standardises several existing open-source tools. 

It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, 
and the associated techniques and knowledge. 
This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks 
into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established 
best-practices. 

Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale 
optimisations on a variety of platforms, 
ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures.
